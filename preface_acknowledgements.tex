The idea to pursue graduate school chrystalized when I was working as a quant for Teza Technologies, a small, academic high frequency trading firm. I witnessed first hand how machine learning and low latency technologies were completely up-ending securities trading. Broad shouldered Wall Street suites were being replaced by hackers and math nerds. As machine learning and automation became increasingly powerful tools for our firm, I began to question whether these tools could spur similar advances in physics and cosmology. 

In 2016, I started the ICME MS program and began working with Philip (Phil) Marshal on high dimensional cosmological inference. In the summer of 2017, Phil introduced me to my eventual advisor, Steven (Steve) Kahn, as someone who could potentially support me for a PhD. I remember our first meeting well. I presented my results. Steve sat there, completely silent. His stern expression gave no indications of his thoughts ... was he even paying attention? After I finished presenting, he asked extremely insightful questions that demonstrated he had been paying careful attention. Indeed, Steve is a great listener. I was also impressed by his creativity and interest in working on problems off the beaten path. Shortly after our first encounter we teamed up to work on star trails, and Steve officially became my PhD advisor. 

I would like to extend Steve my greatest thanks. The two major research efforts that comprise my PhD, star trail photometry and machine learning based wavefront sensing, were speculative and required many different attempts before we were ultimately able to crack them. Steve's patience and willingness to pursue bold problems made this possible. Great collaboration around AI. 

The two major research efforts that comprise my PhD, developing star trail photometry and machine learning based wavefront sensing algorithms, . The former is not a part of this PhD as I ran out of time to include it - we can save it for the journals.  

The other thing that stood out was Steve's creativity. . At the time, when I had struggled to sell other Physics professors on the implications of deep learning for physics - this is almost hard to believe today - .

It started at Teza Technologies, where I was a quant for three years. We had a lot of success developing machine learning algorithms and low latency technologies to trade futures.
