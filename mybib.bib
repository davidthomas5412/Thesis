  abstract =   {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer’s inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization, and in some cases eliminates the need for Dropout. Applied to a stateof-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.82% top-5 test error, exceeding the accuracy of human raters.}

	abstract = {The Dark Energy Camera is a new imager with a 2.Â°2 diameter field of view mounted at the prime focus of the Victor M. Blanco 4Â m telescope on Cerro Tololo near La Serena, Chile. The camera was designed and constructed by the Dark Energy Survey CollaborationÂ and meets or exceeds the stringent requirements designed for the wide-field and supernova surveys for which the collaboration uses it. The camera consists of a five-element optical corrector, seven filters, a shutter with a 60 cm aperture, and a charge-coupled device (CCD) focal plane of 250 ÎŒm thick fully depleted CCDs cooled inside a vacuum Dewar. The 570 megapixel focal plane comprises 62 2k Ã 4k CCDs for imaging and 12 2k Ã 2k CCDs for guiding and focus. The CCDs have 15 ÎŒm Ã 15 ÎŒm pixels with a plate scale of 0.â³263 pixelâ1. A hexapod system provides state-of-the-art focus and alignment capability. The camera is read out in 20 s with 6â9 electronÂ readout noise. This paper provides a technical description of the camera's engineering, construction, installation, and current status.}

abstract = {For large amounts of wavefront error, gradient-based optimization methods for image-based wavefront sensing are unlikely to converge when the starting guess for the wavefront differs greatly from the true wavefront. We use machine learning operating on a point-spread function to determine a good initial estimate of the wavefront. We show that our trained convolutional neural network provides good initial estimates in the presence of simulated detector noise and is more effective than using many random starting guesses for large amounts of wavefront error.},

On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5% and 17.0% which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully-connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overriding in the fully-connected layers we employed a recently-developed regularization method called "dropout" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry.},

ABSTRACT = {In the adaptive optics (AO) system, to improve the effectiveness and accuracy of wavefront sensing-less technology, a phase-based sensing approach using machine learning is proposed. In contrast to the traditional gradient-based optimization methods, the model we designed is based on an improved convolutional neural network. Specifically, the deconvolution layer, which reconstructs unknown input by measuring output, is introduced to represent the phase maps of the point spread functions at the in focus and defocus planes. The improved convolutional neural network is utilized to establish the nonlinear mapping between the input point spread functions and the corresponding phase maps of the optical system. Once well trained, the model can directly output the aberration map of the optical system with good precision. Adequate simulations and experiments are introduced to demonstrate the accuracy and real-time performance of the proposed method. The simulations show that even when atmospheric conditions D/r0 = 20, the detection root-mean-square of wavefront error of the proposed method is 0.1307 &lambda;, which has a better accuracy than existing neural networks. When D/r0 = 15 and 10, the root-mean-square error is respectively 0.0909 &lambda; and 0.0718 &lambda;. It has certain applicative value in the case of medium and weak turbulence. The root-mean-square error of experiment results with D/r0 = 20 is 0.1304 &lambda;, proving the correctness of simulations. Moreover, this method only needs 12 ms to accomplish the calculation and it has broad prospects for real-time wavefront sensing.},
